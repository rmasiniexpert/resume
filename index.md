### Why sell the same message for eveyone?

Everybody is equal to everyone? Of course not! So *why do you keep investing money with marketing ads that send teh same message for everybody?*

A.I. it's transforming the advertisement industry, automating tasks and learining from customer feedback.

But, again, **the majority companies are not "thinking" with the A.I. models, just using these models.**

This is not their fault! Teams and executives are just following protocols, usually from academic specialized data scientist managers. But, again, this approache is fair away from commercial daily operations and goals.

I created a prototype that was validated with 2 different projects, that increase their sales in **30% percent** and reduce marketing **campaing cost in 15%.**
