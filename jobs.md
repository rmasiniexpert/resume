Scraping my future company
================
Rodrigo Masini

I have been working **as an independent contractor Data Scientist for
companies from healthcare, retail, educational, financial, marketing and
law industry for more than 3 years**. Unfortunately, after COVID, the
number of new contracts drop it a lot.

Because of that, I decided to apply for a data scientist position. For a
hire manager this can be an opportunity to check my skills in a small
project that I called: *“What does a market wants from a data
scientist?”*

I will be attempting to clarify what the market are searching and
requiring from a Data Scientist by developing a web scraper for [Indeed
job postings](https://indeed.com).

Web scraping Indeed jobs with R and can easily be accomplished with the
[rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/index.html)
package. With this package, I will get the relevant information from
Indeed’s website is a straight forward process.

First, I will be loading the required packages.

``` r
pacman::p_load("tidyverse","rvest","xml2","stringi","strex")
```

Then I’ll have a look at how to get job titles from the web page. I want
to look for Data Scientist jobs in Orlando, Fl.

## Getting data from Indeed jobs

After we are done with that, we will copy the link address and store the
URL in a variable called URL. Then we will use the xml2 package and the
read\_html function to parse the page. In short, this means that the
function will read in the code from the webpage and break it down into
different elements (div, span, p, etc.) for you to analyze it.

In the code below, I will show you how to get the page into R for you to
analyze it.

### Extracting html site structure

I will extract the html structure from Indeed using the xml2 package.

``` r
url <- "https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Data+Scientist&l=Orlando%2C+FL"
page <- xml2::read_html(url)
```

After, I’m ready to extract relevant nodes from the XML object.

I call elements like divs (div), spans (span), paragraphs (p) or anchors
(a) nodes, after they have been parsed by the xml2::read\_html()
function. Besides element nodes there are also attribute nodes and text
nodes.

But wait…how do I know where to find all the relevant information I’m
looking for? Well, that is the hard part of developing a successful
scraper. Luckily, Indeed’s website is not very hard to scrape.

So, what I will be doing is looking at the source code of the website
and also inspecting individual elements.

### Scraping job titles

The **job titles are located under the anchor tag**. When I look more
into it I can also see it is located under the job title CSS selector
and the xpath **a\[@class="jobtitle"\]**. This makes it so much easier
to find individual pieces on a website. Now you might ask yourself what
CSS Selectors are and what an xpath is.

**Xpath:** a path to specifically extract certain parts from a
tree-structured document such as XML or HTML. The path can be very
specific and makes it possible to grab certain parts from a website
easily.

**CSS Selectors:** A CSS selector has a similar function to xpath.
Namely, locating certain nodes in a document and extracting information
from these nodes. Every CSS selector can be translated into an
equivalent xpath but not the other way around.

So let’s construct the xpath:

**//a\[@data-tn-element = "jobTitle"\]**. Bam\! I get all job titles.
Notice that if I have included //\* instead of //a in my code below, the
star acts as a wildcard and selects all elements or nodes not just the
anchor node. For Indeed’s website, the **attribute data-tn-element** is
always under the anchor node so the wild card symbol wouldn’t be
necessary.

In the code below I’m selecting all div nodes and specify the xpath from
where we grab the attribute title to get all job titles from the
website.

``` r
page %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes("div") %>%
    rvest::html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@data-tn-element = "jobTitle"]') %>%
    rvest::html_attr("title")
```

### Scraping company names and locations

I can see that company location and name are located in the **span**
element with a class attribute value of location and company
respectively.

Let’s see how we can extract this information from the document. First,
we’ll specify the xpath.

``` r
# getting company location
page %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes("span") %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@class="location accessible-contrast-color-location"]')%>% 
    rvest::html_text() %>%
    stringi::stri_trim_both()
```

    rvest::html_nodes("span")  %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@class="company"]')  %>% 
    rvest::html_text() %>%
    stringi::stri_trim_both()
```

    ##  [1] "Deloitte"                    "LSQ"

### Job description

Lastly, I want to get the job description from every single job on the
website. I notice that on the current page, there is just a little meta
description of the job summary. However, **I want to get the full
description of how many years of experience we need, what skill set is
required, and what responsibilities the job entails**.

To do that we have to collect the links on the website. We do that with
the following code.

``` r
page %>% 
  rvest::html_nodes("div") %>%
  rvest::html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@data-tn-element="jobTitle"]') %>%
  rvest::html_attr("href") 
```

### Collecting the job description

After I have collected the links we can now locate where the job
description is located in the document.

After that, I notice that the job description is in a **span** element
with a class attribute values of \*\*//\*\[@id="jobDescriptionText"\]
\[contains(@class,"jobsearch-jobDescriptionText")\]\*\*. But this will
work only for the specific page of the job.

## Wrapping all the code

**That was the majority of my work\!** I’m now done scraping Indeed jobs
with R and can focus now on building a functioning scraper. That means I
have to **put all the different parts together**. One more thing I have
to implement in my scraper multiple page results.

``` r
#implementation of multiple page results

page_result_start <- 0 # starting page 
page_result_end <- 10 # last page results since for Orlando there is only 2 pages

#sequence to the for loop through the pages
page_results <- seq(from = page_result_start, to = page_result_end, by = 10)

#df that I will use to gather partial scrapped information
partial_job_df <- NULL
description <- NULL

#first loop 
for(i in seq_along(page_results)) {

  # the core string domain  
  page_url <- "https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Data+Scientist&l=Orlando%2C+FL" 
  
  # attached string regarding the different number of pages  
  url <- paste0(page_url, "&start=", page_results[i]) 

  # html structure 
  page <- xml2::read_html(url)
  
  # Sys.sleep pauses R for two seconds before it resumes
  # Putting it there avoids error messages such as "Error in open.connection(con, "rb") : Timeout was reached"
  Sys.sleep(3)
  
  #getting the job title
  page %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes("div") %>%
    rvest::html_nodes(xpath = '//a[@data-tn-element = "jobTitle"]') %>%
    rvest::html_attr("title") -> job_title
  
  #getting the company name
  page %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes("span")  %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@class="company"]')  %>% 
    rvest::html_text() %>%
    stringi::stri_trim_both() -> company_name 
  
  
  #getting job location
  page %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes("span") %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@class="location accessible-contrast-color-location"]')%>% 
    rvest::html_text() %>%
    stringi::stri_trim_both() -> job_location
  
  # getting links of job description
  page %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes("div") %>%
    rvest::html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@data-tn-element="jobTitle"]') %>%
    rvest::html_attr("href") -> links
    
  # partial df build from the scrapped information above
  partial_job_df <- rbind(partial_job_df,data_frame(job_title, company_name, job_location))
  
  # second loop
  for(i in seq_along(links)) {
    
    # the core string domain
    url_job <- paste0("https://www.indeed.com", links[i]) 
    
    # html structure
    page_url <- xml2::read_html(url_job)
    
    # extracting job description
    page_url %>%
      rvest::html_nodes("span")  %>% 
      rvest::html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id="jobDescriptionText"][contains(@class,"jobsearch-jobDescriptionText")]') %>% 
      rvest::html_text() %>%
      stringi::stri_trim_both() -> job_description
     
     # df gathering job description
     description <- rbind(description, data_frame(job_description))
    
  }
  
  # df gathering all the information
  full_job_opport <- cbind(partial_job_df, description)
}

 
# some cleaning
full_job_opport$job_description <- gsub("[\r\n]", "", full_job_opport$job_description)

# final df 
df_job_DS_Orlando <- full_job_opport
```

That is it\!

Now let’s find out if there is something that I can fit in.

``` r
df_job_DS_Orlando
```
